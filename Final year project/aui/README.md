# Adaptive User Interface
This is our final year project

# Problem Statement
For any organization it is very important for them to retain their customers/clients, make sure the customer uses their website and caters their expectations. Often, they’re successful in bringing traffic on their website but to retain them is the key. We are proposing an intelligent interface that will adapt to users' requirements/expectations. However human "emotions" are complicated, most of the time the person feeling them is himself not aware of what exactly he is feeling.  This problem isn't specific to a group or community but is a general problem throughout the world. If a software can correctly predict a persons' emotion and take appropriate measures (for the betterment) this could bring a huge positive change in the society.

# Description
Our solution is to make a software that would automatically change/alter the interface of a website if the user is not satisfied with and face challenges while using the website. This change is implemented according to the user's mood. Our application detects the user's emotion through his facial expressions and modifies the interface of the website on the basis of color, font size etc according to the user's mood and requirements.
As soon as the user's logs in on the website our detection model takes a pcture of his face in order to read the emotions and once the emotion is detected our system provides a suitable interface to the user which caters the user’s mood and his requirements ultimately satisfying the user with the website’s interface and retaining the user to use the website.
